(ns construction-supervision.store
  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 3123 independent construction-supervision
  sole-proprietor actor. Store is a protocol injected into the
  `construction-supervision.actor` StateGraph — `MemStore` is the
  default, deterministic, zero-dep backend; a Datomic/kotoba-server-
  backed implementation can be swapped in without touching the actor or
  governor (itonami actor pattern, per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md
  Actors section).

  Domain:

    site     — a registered construction site (:site-id, :name)
    record   — a committed operating record under a site (coordination
               note, phase clearance, near-active-equipment operation,
               next-phase site clearance) — written ONLY via
               commit-record!, never mutated in place
    ledger   — an append-only audit trail of every proposal/verdict/
               disposition, regardless of outcome (commit or hold)")
